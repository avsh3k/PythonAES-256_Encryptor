# PythonAES-256_Encryptor
This script prompts the user for the path of the file to encrypt. It generates a random key, encrypts the file, and then decrypts it. The encrypted file is saved with a .enc extension. Note that this example uses a randomly generated key for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to securely handle and store the encryption key
